## üó£Ô∏è Speech-Based Search Engine

This Python project enables users to perform Google searches using voice commands. It combines speech recognition and text-to-speech to create a hands-free, interactive search assistant.

### üöÄ Features

* üé§ Voice input using microphone
* üîä Voice feedback using text-to-speech
* üåê Performs web searches on Google automatically
* üß† Simple and efficient codebase using popular libraries

### üß∞ Technologies Used

* `speech_recognition` ‚Äì for converting voice to text
* `pyttsx3` ‚Äì for converting text to speech
* `webbrowser` ‚Äì to open search results in a browser

### üìÅ File Structure

```
speech-based-search-engine/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ speech based search engine.py
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
```

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. Connect a working microphone.
2. Run the script:

```bash
python "speech based search engine.py"
```

3. Speak your search query when prompted.
4. The script will recognize your speech, speak back the query, and open Google search results in your default browser.

### üìù Notes

* Make sure your microphone is set up and accessible.
* An active internet connection is required for speech recognition.
* The script uses Google's free speech recognition API.
